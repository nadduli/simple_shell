# Project on 0x16. C - Simple Shell  

## Description
 In this project, we have coded it from scratch to create a simple Unix shell. A shell is an interactive > command-line interpreter.  
 We created a shell that would utilize the command line > interface (CLI). It allows users to type in a defined set of > commands (e.g. "rm" to remove files, "cat" to combine word documents, etc) and have the > operating system run the appropriate function. It is slightly different from a graphical user > interface (GUI).   
 For instance, instead of using a mouse to click to open folders and delete files, a user > can type in a command (i.e. "ls" or "rm") and have the files be displayed or > modified in a list on the command line.  
 GUI and CLI both have the same purpose to interact > with the operating system but their input methods are different and some developers > prefer the CLI to interact with the shell because their typing is quicker than > clicking and dragging. There are a few > versions of Unix shells, from the very first (Ken Thompson's) shell that can > be activated by typing ```sh``` in the terminal to today's most popular Bash > (Bourne Again Shell).  
 Later versions of the shell handle memory leaks better and > have more functionality. Our shell is a simple version that handles memory leaks > very well and has basic functionality. You can create/write/read/open/remove > folders, print things to the terminal, change directories, print where you are > in the system, etc.
